RegionPlot
=========
The R package **RegionPlot** is a visualization tool to interpret and visualize the result of Genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Especially for pig GWAS researchers, we implemented a comprehensive, simple and automatable R package to regionally plot the association results in pig. It also can be used for other species with slightly modification.
